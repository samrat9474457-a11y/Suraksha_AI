# Suraksha_AI

Suraksha_Ai is a Python-based project developed and executed entirely using **Google Colab**. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook format and focuses on working with a safety-related dataset using basic machine learning and data analysis techniques.

## Project Structure

- **Suraksha_Ai.ipynb**  
  The main notebook file created and run on Google Colab containing all code and outputs.

## Notebook Overview

The notebook includes the following steps:

1. **Importing Required Libraries**  
   Necessary Python libraries are imported directly within the Colab environment.

2. **Dataset Loading**  
   The dataset is loaded into the notebook for analysis and processing.

3. **Data Exploration & Preprocessing**  
   Initial exploration and preparation of data for further computation.

4. **Model Implementation**  
   Machine learning logic is applied based on the available data.

5. **Results & Output**  
   Outputs and results are displayed within the notebook cells.

## Platform Used

- **Google Colab**
  - No local setup required
  - Runs on cloud-based Jupyter environment

## Requirements

Since the project is executed on Google Colab, no manual installation is required.  
Commonly used libraries include:
- pandas   
- scikit-learn  

(All are pre-installed in Google Colab.)

## How to Run

1. Upload `Suraksha_Ai.ipynb` to Google Colab.
2. Open the notebook.
3. Run the cells sequentially from top to bottom.

## Notes

- This project is created for learning and academic purposes.
- All code, logic, and results are contained within the notebook.
- No additional scripts or configuration files are required.

## Author

Developed as part of an academic project using Google Colab for AI-based safety applications.
